<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>

	<p>You must be a Haloscan member.<br />
This is a Haloscan-only feature. If you do not have an account with Haloscan, sign up for one <a href="http://haloscan.com/members/join.php">here</a>.</p>
	<p><b>Installation instruction:</b></p>
	<p>Simply include these lines of code onto your blogger template (or your other site if it uses the Haloscan commenting system)</p>
	<blockquote><p><code>&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"<br />
src="http://lasthalo.uzyn.com/show.php?u=<em><b>YOUR_USERNAME</b></em>"&gt;<br />

&lt;/script&gt;</code></p></blockquote>
	<p>With common sense, you shold know that you should replace YOUR_USERNAME with your Haloscan username. Note that it's Haloscan username, not Blogger username.</p>
	<p>Typically, you would want to include the code onto the sidebar.</p>
	<p>I would be very grateful if you could also display some form of acknowledgement on your blog by including the following code:</p>
	<blockquote><p><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lasthalo.uzyn.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Powered by LastHalo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p></blockquote>

	<p>It would be best if you could insert that line immediately after <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p>
	<p>Good day!</p>
	<p>----------</p>
	<p><b>Documentation / Extra Features:</b></p>
	<ol>
	<li>In general, this is the code you would be getting by installing LastHalo on your blog:<br />

	<blockquote><p><code>&lt;div class="lasthalo"&gt;<br />
<i>&lt;!-- Hyperlinks to the last comments --&gt;</i><br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
</code></p></blockquote>
	<p>It is wrapped under a class "lasthalo". You can customised the style with CSS on your blog, if you are familiar with CSS.</li>
